## Abstract
BCIs constitute a promising tool for treating or circumventing neurological symptoms and
promoting neurorehabilitation strategies. Yet, they fail to detect mental intentions in about 30% of
the users. Multiple ways to tackle this issue have been proposed, mainly by either establishing a
machine capable of sensing subtle variations in the data that are consistent enough for a precise
controller or by finding consistent behavior and patterns of training. In this workshop, we propose
to bridge the gap between these aspects by focusing on the identification, the selection, and the
assessment of the information used to translate the brain activity into commands, namely, the
features.
The workshop will be split into three parts. In the first part, an overview of existing and emerging
features will be presented. The second part will be dedicated to the clinical relevance of novel
features. The third part will focus on guidelines and concrete recommendations when dealing with
the BCI features’ instability. Finally, to structure the general discussion in direct alignment with the
challenges faced by the community, the discussion will be guided by a selection of pre-arranged
questions asked by the participants head on.


## Intended audience
This workshop is designed for participants with a minimal background in both neuroscience and
engineering and, ideally, with some familiarity with signal processing techniques. By the end of the
workshop, participants will get acquainted with various types of traditional and emerging features
used in BCI, the pros and cons of each of these, their limitations, and of course, their ideal BCI
applicability context. Finally, attendees will bring home new types of neurophysiologically-
grounded analysis and open-source tools to use on their own data to better characterize the
subjects’ intents.


## Interactive Component
The workshop will include multiple interactive components throughout the session.
First, an online survey via an app will allow us to get a broad view of the main research profiles
and expertise present in the audience, and where they place themselves in the BCI landscape. This
survey will form the basis of understanding what most people do, and what they could do
diﬀerently. Furthermore, by relying to a list of research contributions to the BCI meeting on
feature-related topics, we will give to young researchers the opportunity to deliver a “trailer speech”
of 1 minute or displaying a study slide that will serve to launch the discussion on the cutting-edge
trends in this field. Based on the discussions and talks throughout the session, a concept document
serving as a basis for an opinion paper will be compiled encapsulating the proceedings and outputs
of the workshop and the contributions by all attendees to it. 

## Expected output(s)
Opinion paper in a BCI journal to attract the attention of the engineering and neuroscientific
communities to the challenges of identifying, selecting, and evaluating neurophysiologically
relevant features in BCI.
We also expect contributions from diﬀerent teams interested in a broader range of features to the
open-source tools presented during the workshop via new releases.
